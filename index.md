features:
  - title: Intuitive Visual Workflow Builder
    details: Visually construct complex AI workflows using a drag-and-drop interface. Design, understand, and debug sophisticated logic without getting lost in code, making both simple tasks and complex agentic systems easy to manage.
  - title: Build Powerful Autonomous Agents
    details: Go beyond simple chains. Empower a Large Language Model to act as an agent that can reason, plan, and use other nodes or even workflows and oter agents to dynamically solve complex, open-ended problems in a continuous loop.
  - title: Expose Workflows as APIs
    details: Instantly turn any workflow into a conversational agent accessible via a standard, OpenAI-compatible API. Features automatic, multi-turn conversation to gather necessary inputs before execution.
  - title: Sophisticated Control Flow
    details: Implement conditional logic, create loops, and manage complex execution paths using sub-workflows (Leaves) to build truly dynamic workflows/agents.
  - title: Infinitely Extensible
    details: Built for developers. Create your own custom nodes to integrate with any third-party API or proprietary system. If you cancode it, you can add it to your CozyUI toolbox.
  - title: Rich Built-in Node Library
    details: Hit the ground running with a comprehensive set of ready-to-use nodes for web searches, file I/O, data manipulation, and various LLM prompting patterns like summarization, Q&A, and more.
