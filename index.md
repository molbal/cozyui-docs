features:
  - title: Intuitive Visual Workflow Builder
    details: Visually construct complex AI workflows using a drag-and-drop interface. Design, understand, and debug sophisticated logic without getting lost in code, making both simple tasks and complex agentic systems easy to manage.

    icon: 🪛
  - title: Build Powerful Autonomous Agents
    details: Go beyond simple chains. Empower a Large Language Model to act as an agent that can reason, plan, and use other nodes or even workflows and oter agents to dynamically solve complex, open-ended problems in a continuous loop.
